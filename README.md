Project Description

The Employee Time Tracking System is a comprehensive database solution developed to manage and monitor employee work hours, attendance, shift schedules, and leave requests. Designed for organizations of all sizes, the system streamlines various timekeeping processes, improving efficiency and ensuring accurate payroll calculations. This project aims to eliminate manual time tracking errors and increase operational productivity by automating critical HR functions.

The system allows HR departments and managers to track employee attendance, record daily work hours, manage shifts, and handle leave requests. It includes tables for storing employee details, timesheets, shift schedules, and attendance records, all interconnected to provide accurate and real-time data. This ensures compliance with labor laws, reduces administrative overhead, and enables managers to make informed decisions regarding staffing and scheduling. By implementing this system, organizations can ensure accurate compensation for employees, reduce discrepancies in 
payroll, and improve overall workforce management.

Tasks Performed

1.	Database Design and Structure:
The first task was to design and structure the relational database, which includes creating tables for employees, timesheets, shifts, attendance, and leave management. Each table was designed with appropriate fields to store relevant data, ensuring consistency and integrity across the system.

2.	SQL Queries and Data Relationships:
The next task involved writing SQL queries to implement the relationships between tables. Foreign key constraints were established to connect tables such as linking employees to their respective timesheets, shifts, and attendance records. This helps maintain data integrity and ensures that each entry in the system corresponds correctly to an employee.


3.	Data Entry and Testing:
After the database schema was created, test data was inserted into the tables to simulate real-world usage. This included adding employee records, timesheet entries, shift schedules, and attendance statuses. Testing queries were then run to ensure that the system could retrieve and update data correctly and that reports could be generated for payroll and shift management.

4.	Attendance and Shift Management:
A key aspect of this project was to implement systems for tracking employee attendance and managing shift assignments. Queries were developed to monitor employee attendance on specific dates, track leave requests, and assign employees to different shifts based on availability and business needs.


5.	Timesheet and Payroll Calculation:
In this task, logic for calculating total hours worked, including overtime, was implemented. SQL queries were written to compute total hours for each employee based on their clock-in and clock-out times, and overtime hours were tracked separately. This ensured that payroll calculations would be accurate and based on real-time data.

6.	Reporting and Analytics:
Reports were developed to display essential information such as employee work hours, attendance patterns, and shift schedules. The data was organized into formats that could be used for payroll processing, attendance analysis, and managerial decision-making.


7.	System Documentation and Final Review:
The final task was to document the entire project, including the database schema, SQL queries, and the systemâ€™s functionality. This documentation ensures that the system can be easily understood, maintained, and modified in the future. A final review was conducted to ensure that the system was fully functional, accurate, and user-friendly.
